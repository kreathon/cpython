Remove the compiler functions using ``struct _mod`` type, because the public
AST C API was removed:

* ``PyAST_Compile()``
* ``PyAST_CompileEx()``
* ``PyAST_CompileObject()``
* ``PyFuture_FromAST()``
* ``PyFuture_FromASTObject()``

These functions were undocumented and excluded from the limited C API.
Patch by Victor Stinner.
